Probblem A
	compile: g++ -o lab3 main.cpp
	execution: ./lab3
Problem B
	//size=1000
	sort(): 0 seconds
	v1/v2 are different.
	insertion_sort(): 0.01 seconds
	v1/v2 are the same.

	//size=10000
	sort(): 0 seconds
	v1/v2 are different.
	insertion_sort(): 1.28 seconds
	v1/v2 are the same.

	//size=10000
	sort(): 0.04 seconds
	v1/v2 are different.
	insertion_sort(): 128.17 seconds
	v1/v2 are the same.

	//size=100000
	sort(): 0.52 seconds
	v1/v2 are different.
	insertion_sort(): 12820.7 seconds
	v1/v2 are the same.

	O(nlogn) and O(n^2) means the running time of each algorithm.
	Comparing the result of sort() and insertion_sort(), we can find that the running time of insertion_sort() grows more obviously than sort().
